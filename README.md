This repository contains the MATLAB project code developed for the course "Signals and Systems" during the third semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens. Additionally, it includes a text file with an introduction and another with detailed explanations. Suggestions for improving these files are highly welcome and appreciated!

The professors have provided the files "SS22_IntroductoryDemo_1.m" and "SS20_IntroductoryMiniDemo_2.m" to assist students with their projects.
