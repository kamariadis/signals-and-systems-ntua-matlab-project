This repository contains the MATLAB project developed for the course "Signals and Systems", taken during the third semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. Additionally, it includes a pdf file with an introduction (provided by the profesors) and the original sounds. Suggestions for improving these files are highly welcome and appreciated!
